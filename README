sabotage's linux kernel headers

linux headers are often broken for userspace, so we provide
our own copy for the archs supported by sabotage.
additionally downloading the entire kernel tarball just to
get the headers is overkill.

this currently uses headers of kernel 3.3.4, which proved
to be quite stable in the past. they will be updated to
newer versions in irregular intervals.
